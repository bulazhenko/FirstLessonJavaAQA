1) Write a simple Java program using any text editor. Compile this program using Java compiler and run it from the console.
You can write whatever you want, but program should compile and should print something to a console.
2) Write a program which creates and initializes all primitive data types.
Remark: There are 8 primitive data types.
3) Create an integer variable "a". Try to assign a value to it the doesn't match the allowed range. What happened? Find in your favorite search engine the explanation.
4) Answer the question: What the difference between integers and floating-point numbers?
5) Read about ASCII. Write unicodes for all characters in a word "Hello".
6) Create a simple program with several constants. Try to reassign a value for any of them and compile you program. What happened?
7) Create an array of 10 integers. Initialize this array with any values except 0. Print the length of the array to a console.
8) Create an array of 5 doubles. Get the first and the last element of the array an write them to variables.
9) Read about version control systems, such as GIT. Create your own repository on Github. It will be used throughout this course to contribute your homeworks.

1 Task:

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Summer Time Sadness");
        System.err.println("Example of error print");
    }

2 Task:

  public static byte cat = 1;
  public static short dog = 2;
  public static int fish = 4;
  public static long snake = 8;
  public static float owl = 3.4f;
  public static double shark = 6.7;
  public static char a = 65;
  public static boolean isCold = true;
  public static boolean isHot = false;
}

3 Task:

public class Main {

  public static int a = 10.1;
}
Error:(26, 27) java: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int

Because the value is not a type of int. (Becuse this value is a float point number).

4 Task:

Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data.
An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point.
A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place.
Floats are used when more precision is needed.

5 Task:

H = 72;
e = 101;
l = 108;
l = 108;
